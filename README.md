BusinessHours
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nikdoof/businesshours.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nikdoof/businesshours)

```businesshours``` is a small Python module that contains tools to assist with calculating business/working hours. This project was made to solve a particular problem I was facing, and while it probably doesn't cover the edge cases it works "good enough".

Patches/issues/pulls are welcome.
